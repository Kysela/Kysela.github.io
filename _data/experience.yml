   Wflow is a software company which is primarily engaged in the digital transformation of accounting. My position there was a direct technical support with the clients. From basic tasks to setting up their accounts, connecting them to ERP systems directly via TeamViewer on their devices, having phone calls about various issues and reporting the issues back to the development team. I worked there for the first time with Pohoda, Abra Flexi and Dativery. It was a great position to learn basics about accounting and the software which is on basis used here.

   Worked as internal technical support for everything Android related. From getting through the password protected devices, creating backdoors, finding new ways to obtain data from the device... To daily communication with the users. This role game an amazing view on how security companies, including CIA, FBI and Interpol handle mobile forensics, since I had a chance to see how one of a few companies on the world and the only company in Czech Republic is handling it. I worked with some of the best people in Czechia and highly improved my knowledge perspective on Android and IOS internals, I also directly used proprietary software used by other top forensic companies on the world, including UFED by Cellebrite and products from Oxygen Forensics.
