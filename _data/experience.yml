          Working at NatWest as a front end engineer focusing mostly on a corporate banking product called Bankline.
          Working as part of a scrum team consiting of 5 developers, 2 testers and a PO/BA I have the oportunity to help drive the team forwards and
          work with the PO defining what we are building.
          I spend most of my time working on a specifc area of a large application that our team take ownership over. The front end is a <mark>React</mark> app
          that talks to an API built using a collection of <mark>Java</mark> microservices. I have spent time working in multiple parts of the stack including
          helping to define our front end architecure to follow best practices to implementing PDF and CSV export in a microservice.
          Last year I took the lead on rebuilding the login journey to our application. I worked with the architects and designers to create something that would
          be fit for purpose and be easy to maintain for years to come. I then built this to a high standard which lead to a seamless switch over from the previous
          system with no issues. More recently I have acted as a consultant to external teams and application architects to advise on how we should be building new
          functionality within our application. I have also built reusable components to the same standards as opensource libraries which have been used by different teams across the bank.
          I enjoy learning about all areas of our application which allows me to be a go-to person for knowledge and queries within my team and the other teams
          in the office. I am always looking to suggest improvements and challenge what and how we are working to make sure we are delivering the best service
          to the customers while also developing to the highest standards.
