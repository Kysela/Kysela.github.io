    As an Internal Technical Support at Compelson, I was responsible for all things Android related, from breaking through password-protected devices and creating backdoors, to finding new ways to obtain data from the device. My daily interactions with users gave me an opportunity to see firsthand how security companies, including CIA, FBI, and Interpol, handle mobile forensics. Compelson is one of the few companies in the world, and the only one in the Czech Republic, that specializes in this field, so I was fortunate to learn from some of the best people in the industry. In this role, I greatly improved my knowledge and perspective on Android and IOS internals, and even had the chance to use proprietary software from other top forensic companies in the world, such as UFED by Cellebrite and products from Oxygen Forensics. Joining Compelson was an incredible opportunity to gain valuable insight into the fascinating world of mobile forensics and expand my skillset as an Internal Technical Support.
