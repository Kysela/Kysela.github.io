   Definitely my biggest project which I ever started as a teenager on high school

    Development of this project was planned since July 2018, which was the time when my first project, RedWolf Recovery ended. The idea of building a completely new custom recovery from scratch was for everyone incredibly crazy, but I like to challenge myself and I felt like that if I don't try, I will regret it later. It took like a year and a half of messing around until I built the right architecture on which this project is now based on. At this point it's still in alpha development stage, since it's really hard to find people for contributions but if you want to help this project grow, then check out it's Github, it's open source for a reason! ;)

    I'm proud to have initiated the RedWolf Recovery Project, born out of my passion for Android and tinkering with custom ROMs and kernels. Starting from scratch, I poured my heart and soul into creating my own version of TWRP custom recovery. As my programming skills improved, so did the project, eventually garnering a user base of around 100,000 people. Today, RedWolf Recovery Project is hailed as the mother of TWRP-based custom development, with many modern projects deriving from this work. Some of the main features introduced include recovery password protection, support for incremental MIUI OTA updates, and automatic deactivation of DM-verity and forced encryption.
