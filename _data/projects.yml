  description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
    This project was started completely only out of my own passion for Android, i enjoyed flashing different custom ROMs, kernels and other modifications on my phone through TWRP custom recovery, so that was the time when i thought about making my own version of it. At the beggining i didn't even know what i'm doing but as time went, my programming skills were getting better, project started to grow and number of users started to increase until project reached something around 100000 users. This project is now called as the mother of custom TWRP based development, since all modern TWRP based projects are now deriving from this work.
