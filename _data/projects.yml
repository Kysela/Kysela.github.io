    This project was started completely only out of my own passion for Android, i enjoyed flashing different custom ROMs, kernels and other modifications on my phone through TWRP custom recovery, so that was the time when i thought about making my own version of it. At the beggining i didn't even know what i'm doing but as time went, project started to grow, number of users started to increase day by day until project reached something around 100000 users.
