    During my time in high school, I immersed myself in everything related to computer networks. From mastering the ins and outs of managing Windows servers and Linux machines, to studying the fundamental concepts of networking models and theory, I was hooked.

    But my curiosity didn't stop there. In my free time, I worked on a variety of personal projects that allowed me to flex my coding muscles. I honed my skills in languages like C/C++ and Bash, constantly pushing myself to take on new challenges and explore the limitless potential of programming.

    Looking back on those formative years, I realize that my passion for computer networks and coding has been with me from the very beginning. And now, as a seasoned professional, I am eager to share that passion with others and take on exciting new challenges in the field.
