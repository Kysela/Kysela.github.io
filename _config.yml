  Hi, my name is Frank, or also František in czech, i started to be interested in software development already in elementary school when i had a huge passion for mobile phones, especially Android based devices. I was all day long studying how Android works, how boot animation is loaded, how you can change boot logo, or how user can gain root access. When i got in to high school i extended my interest by getting in to the Android community based development scene, there i launched on my own two big personal projects, got incredible amount of experience and met a lot of new people, since then i'm focusing mostly on my personal projects.
  
  I am most skilled in: <mark>c/c++</mark> and <mark>bash</mark>

  This is where you can write a little more about yourself. You could title this section **Interests** and include some of your other interests.
  Or you could title it **Skills** and write a bit more about things that make you more desirable, like *leadership* or *teamwork*
