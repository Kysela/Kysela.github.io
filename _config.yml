  Hi, my name's Frank, i started to be interested in software development already in elementary school when i was deeply interested in mobile phones, especially Android based devices. I was all day long studying how Android works, how boot animation is loaded, or how user can gain root access. When i got in to high school i extended my interest by getting in to the Android community based development scene, there i launched on my own two big personal projects, got incredible amount of experience and met a lot of new people. 



  I am most skilled in: <mark>turning caffeine in to code</mark> and <mark>Eating Pizza</mark>
