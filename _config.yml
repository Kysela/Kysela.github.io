  Hey there! My name is <mark>Frank</mark>, or <mark>František</mark> for my Czech friends. I'm not just any freelance developer - I specialize in e-commerce and Android platform development. I've been fascinated by the world of Android platform development since I was 14 years old, and I've been honing my skills for over 5 years now. I've had the opportunity to work on some of the biggest projects in the development scene, which serve as a showcase of my work.

  When it comes to e-commerce, I'm the go-to developer for several online shops. I know how to build sales funnels that convert, and I've learned from the best in the business. I'm always eager to work with people who share my passion for e-commerce and Android development.

  So if you're looking for a developer who is as passionate about your project as you are, don't hesitate to hit me up! I'm always open to new challenges and ready to take your project to the next level.
